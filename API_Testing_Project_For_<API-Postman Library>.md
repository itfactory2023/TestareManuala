<h2>Defects found</h2>

No issues were identified while running the postman tests.<br>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

**Test Coverage: A comprehensive set of 15 API tests was created, covering diverse functionalities in the Postman Library API. Tests included various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) for thorough coverage.

Test Execution: Successful execution of the entire collection using Postman's runner. Detailed execution reports were generated, providing insights into each test case's performance and status.

Functionalities Covered: Extensive testing of library books, item management, books adding and retrieval, and checking out books. A variety of scenarios, including positive, negative, and performance testing, were explored.

Issues Identified: No defects were discovered. Addressing eventual issues is crucial before considering a production release to ensure a stable and reliable API.

Lessons Learned: Documentation Impact: Clear documentation on creating access tokens was valuable for establishing a robust testing environment. Collaboration Significance: Continuous collaboration with the development team is vital to align testing efforts with ongoing API changes, ensuring the testing process remains effective and relevant.**
